## ESC2 
When a certificate template specifies the `Any Purpose Extended Key Usage (EKU)` or does not identify any Extended Key Usage, the certificate can be used for any purpose (client authentication, server authentication, code signing, etc.). If the template allows specifying a SAN in the CSR, a template vulnerable to ESC2 can be exploited similarly to ESC1.

#### ESC2 Abuse Requirements
To abuse ESC2, the following conditions must be met:
* The Enterprise CA must provide enrollment rights to low-privileged users.
* Manager approval should be turned off.
* No authorized signatures should be necessary.
* The security descriptor of the certificate template must be excessively permissive, allowing low-privileged users to enroll for certificates.
* The certificate template should define Any Purpose Extended Key Usage or have no Extended Key Usage specified.
