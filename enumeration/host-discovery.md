### Host Discovery 

Questions to consider when mapping the network:
	1. What hosts are discoverable on the subnet with a regular ping sweep? 
	2. What hosts are discoverable on the subnet with a (no ping) ping sweep?
	3. How many DNS servers exist in the network? (Name servers, MX record) 
	4. Can you perform a zone transfer to find additional IP addresses?
  5. Draw the network map 

```
# Fping
fping -f scope > pingsweep.txt

# Nmap ICMP & TCP on port 80 & 443 
nmap -sn -iL ips.txt > live-hosts.txt

# Nmap ICMP only 
nmap -PE ips.txt

# Nmap TCP only 
uses small list of ports to perform TCP scan - if any additional hosts show up these most likely will be sitting behind firewalls
nmap -n -sn -PS22,135,443,445 ips.txt

# arp scanner 
run arp_scanner -r 10.10.100.10/24

# Nmap DNS 
nmap -sS -sU -p53 <subnet>

# DNS name servers 
>>nslookup 
>>server <IP>
>>set q=NS 
>>domain name 
look up each individual name server to find the IP address 

# DNS MX records
>>nslookup 
>>server <IP> 
>>set q=MX
>>domain name 
look up mail server to find the IP address

# DNS Zone Transfer 
dig @dns server <domain> -f AXFR +nocookie 
host -t axfr domain <dns server IP>
