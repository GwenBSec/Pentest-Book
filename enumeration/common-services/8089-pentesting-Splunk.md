## Attacking Splunk  
utilize reverse_shell_splunk - A simple splunk package for obtaining reverse shells on both windows and most *nix systems. Create our payload (run.ps1 or rev.py) by adding IP address and port. Tar the file & upload on onto Splunk.

```bash
update rev.py with LHOST & LPORT
update extension in run.bat to match payload
```
